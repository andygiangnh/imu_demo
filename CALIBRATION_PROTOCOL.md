## Summary of Calibration Protocol Implementation

### New Concise Communication Protocol:
**Gyroscope Calibration:**
- Command: `c`
- Responses: 
  - `c1` = calibration in progress (with progress dots)
  - `c2` = calibration completed successfully
  - `c3` = calibration failed

**Magnetometer Calibration:**
- Command: `m`
- Responses:
  - `m1` = calibration in progress (with progress dots) 
  - `m2` = calibration completed successfully

### GUI Features:
1. **Button State Management:**
   - All command buttons are disabled during calibration
   - Buttons are automatically re-enabled when calibration completes
   - Emergency "Enable All Buttons" button for manual recovery

2. **Safety Features:**
   - 60-second timeout for calibration monitoring
   - Automatic button re-enabling in case of errors
   - Manual button recovery option

### Arduino Firmware:
- Uses only concise status codes (no verbose messages)
- Progress updates sent every 500 samples (~5 seconds) for magnetometer
- Progress updates sent every 100 samples for gyroscope
- Magnetometer calibration takes exactly 30 seconds
- Gyroscope calibration takes about 2.5 seconds (500 samples at 5ms intervals)

### Benefits:
✅ Clean, concise communication protocol  
✅ Better user experience with disabled buttons during calibration  
✅ Real-time progress feedback  
✅ Robust error handling  
✅ Manual recovery options  

### Testing Requirements:
⚠️  **IMPORTANT:** Must upload updated Arduino firmware for GUI to work properly
⚠️  Old firmware with verbose messages will not work with this version
