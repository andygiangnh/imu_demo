## Yaw Stability Improvements

### Problem Identified:
Despite having magnetometer providing absolute north reference, yaw was still drifting significantly. Roll and pitch remained accurate, but yaw accumulated error over time.

### Root Causes Analysis:
1. **Too Conservative Magnetometer Fusion**: Original 98% gyro + 2% magnetometer was insufficient to counteract gyro drift
2. **Long Wait Time**: 200ms wait before applying corrections allowed too much drift accumulation
3. **High Movement Sensitivity**: 10°/s² threshold was triggering too easily, preventing corrections
4. **Weak Correction Strength**: 2% magnetometer influence couldn't overcome accumulated gyro errors

### Improvements Implemented:

#### 1. **Increased Magnetometer Correction Strength**
- **Before**: `gz = gz * 0.98 + relativeHeading * 0.02` (2% mag influence)
- **After**: `gz = gz * 0.95 + relativeHeading * 0.05` (5% mag influence)
- **Benefit**: 2.5x stronger magnetometer correction to actively fight drift

#### 2. **Faster Correction Response**
- **Before**: `stableWaitTime = 200ms`
- **After**: `stableWaitTime = 100ms`
- **Benefit**: Corrections applied 2x faster, reducing drift accumulation time

#### 3. **Reduced Movement Detection Sensitivity**
- **Before**: `gyrZderivativeThreshold = 10.0°/s²`
- **After**: `gyrZderivativeThreshold = 15.0°/s²`
- **Benefit**: Allows corrections during minor movements, only disables for significant rotations

#### 4. **Enhanced Debug Information**
- Added real-time relative heading display in 'a' command
- Shows current magnetometer heading vs reference
- Helps diagnose when corrections are active/disabled

### Expected Results:
✅ **Reduced Yaw Drift**: 2.5x stronger magnetometer corrections  
✅ **Faster Stabilization**: Corrections applied in 100ms instead of 200ms  
✅ **Better Responsiveness**: Less aggressive movement detection  
✅ **Maintained Accuracy**: Roll/pitch unchanged, yaw improved  
✅ **Better Debugging**: Enhanced status information  

### Testing Commands:
- **`'a'`** - Monitor adaptive filter status and magnetometer corrections
- **`'h'`** - Check current magnetometer heading
- **`'z'`** - Reset yaw and magnetometer reference if drift accumulates
- **`'.'`** - Monitor yaw stability over time

### Technical Details:

#### **Filter Comparison:**
| Parameter | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Mag Influence | 2% | 5% | 2.5x stronger |
| Wait Time | 200ms | 100ms | 2x faster |
| Movement Threshold | 10°/s² | 15°/s² | Less sensitive |
| Correction Frequency | Lower | Higher | More frequent |

#### **Magnetometer Absolute Reference:**
- **True North Available**: Yes, magnetometer provides absolute magnetic north
- **Tilt Compensated**: Heading calculation accounts for roll/pitch
- **Reference Tracking**: System tracks relative changes from calibrated reference
- **Drift Prevention**: Magnetometer continuously corrects accumulated gyro errors

#### **When Corrections Apply:**
- ✅ **Device is stable** (gyro derivative < 15°/s²)
- ✅ **No magnetic environment change** detected
- ✅ **Wait time elapsed** (>100ms since last movement)
- ❌ **During high movement** (prevents lag/noise)
- ❌ **During magnetic interference** (prevents false corrections)

### Monitoring Yaw Performance:
1. **Use 'a' command** to check if magnetometer corrections are active
2. **Watch "Mag correction: ENABLED/DISABLED"** status
3. **Monitor relative heading** vs yaw angle over time
4. **Check field strength** for magnetic interference
5. **Reset with 'z'** if significant drift accumulates

### If Drift Persists:
If yaw still drifts after these improvements, you can:
1. **Increase magnetometer influence further** (e.g., 90% gyro + 10% mag)
2. **Reduce wait time more** (e.g., 50ms)
3. **Check magnetometer calibration quality** with 'm' command
4. **Monitor for magnetic interference** in your environment
5. **Consider absolute heading mode** (always use mag heading for stationary periods)

The system now has much more aggressive yaw drift correction while maintaining responsive movement tracking!
